Boilerplate
===========

This is a basic boilerplate with a build in database, and a basic setup with express 4.4.4, express-hbs, gruntjs, with a command to run the project and build it and start the server width 1 command.

To get started just run:

    npm run startup
  
This will build the project including, npm install, sass build & javascript minifing

It will run the node server on port 3000, this is changed in the index.js - it will cast an error if you have something running on port 3000 already
